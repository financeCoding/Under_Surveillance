Agents of P.R.I.S.M
==================

This is our **award winning** entry at the **London GameCraft 2013**.

The game is written in **Dart** using the **StageXL** framework, and developed from scratch by one person in less than 11 hours, it's also the first time I have used **Dart** in ernest.

# Mission Brief

The theme given to us was 'Impact of P.R.I.S.M'.

it’s the cre­ation of a sur­veil­lance capa­bil­ity that whilst can serve to help pre­vent crime and ter­ror­ist attacks, is also sub­ject to mis­use and abuse


If under­used and unable to stop the sort of dis­as­ter it is intended to pre­vent, it’ll no doubt come under much pub­lic crit­i­cism. On the other hand, if it’s mis­used or overused and cause too much intru­sion to every­day lives of inno­cent peo­ple then it’ll also cause pub­lic unrest. It is there­fore a fine bal­ance between not doing enough and doing too much, and it is this need for bal­ance that we wanted to focus on with Agents of P.R.I.S.M.
